Requirements, Constraints and Risks
• Requirements
o Data security and privacy: AI-powered educational apps must adhere to
strict privacy and data security standards to protect users' sensitive
information.
o Scalability and performance: As the user base grows, the application
must be able to handle the increased traffic and usage without impacting
performance.
o Personalization Accuracy: The AI algorithms used to create personalized
learning paths and content must demonstrate a high degree of accuracy
in understanding each individual's learning style, interests, and
strengths.
o The app must be user-friendly, accessible, and culturally sensitive. It
should support multiple languages, accommodate diverse learning
styles, and work on various devices.
• Constraints
o Resource restrictions: Developing an AI-powered application requires
significant computational resources. Limited resources for community
outreach and technology access in some areas might impact app
adoption.
o Program Alignment: AI-generated content and learning pathways must
be closely aligned with relevant curriculum standards.
o
• Risks
o Ethical Considerations: The AI algorithms used in the app may
inadvertently introduce biases or inaccuracies during the creation of
personalized content.
o User acceptance: The introduction of AI into the educational process
may face resistance from traditionalists or users unfamiliar with the
technology.
o Data privacy: Data privacy concerns, potential biases in AI algorithms,
and technological infrastructure challenges in remote areas could pose
risks. Due to the sensitive nature of educational data, there is a
significant risk of data breach or unauthorized access.
Initial Assessment of Tools and Techniques:
